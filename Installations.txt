Installations: 
Bioinformatics tools/Softwares can be installed in multiple ways, i.e., 
A. pre-built binaries B. source code (manual installtions from scratch), C. Dockerization of tools.  D. Conda

C. Dockerization of tools
Docker engine can be installed using the following documentation: https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/
Dockers can be installed in two ways i.e., 
a. creating dockerfiles and building them manually, 
b. pulling pre-built docker containers

1. Dockers : Docker is a software platform that allows users to build, test, and deploy applications quickly. 
Docker containers have everything the software needs to run including libraries, system tools, code, and runtime. 
Using Docker, any user can utilise the required softwares in their desired environments.

website: https://hub.docker.com/
This website has the pre-built dockers of multiple tools. Docker containers can be pulled directly from here. 
Otherwise, the user has to create Dockerfiles for each tool and build them manually.

D. Installations using conda 
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh -O miniconda.sh
bash miniconda.sh -b -p /opt/conda && \
    rm miniconda.sh && \
    /opt/conda/bin/conda clean -tipy && \
    ln -s /opt/conda/etc/profile.d/conda.sh /etc/profile.d/conda.sh && \
    echo ". /opt/conda/etc/profile.d/conda.sh" >> ~/.bashrc && \
    echo "conda activate base" >> ~/.bashrc
    
conda create -n ngs_pipeline python=3.8 -y
conda activate ngs_pipeline
conda install -n ngs_pipeline -c conda-forge -c bioconda fastqc trimmomatic cutadapt bowtie2 samtools varscan snpsift ensembl-vep -y
conda deactivate ngs_pipeline
